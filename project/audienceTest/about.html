      <h4>The Relationship Between Hmong Fashion and Hmong Women in the Central Valley</h4>
<h5>Douagee Cheng and Ia Lo</h5>

<p>
This research project examines the relationship between Hmong fashion and Hmong women in the Central Valley. Hmong women have assimilated into the American culture yet they continue to negotiate their identities through the commercialization and consumption of Hmong fashion. Through this cultural authentication framework, Hmong women are agents of change by selecting, characterizing, incorporating, and transforming Hmong fashion trends and techniques. Social media and Hmong media have become major sites for transmitting trends. Increase in personal capital of Hmong women fosters the growth of the Hmong fashion industry. This qualitative research examines personal experiences and observations of Hmong women who identify as entrepreneurs, producers, consumers, and self-designers in the Hmong fashion industry. The analysis of historical data and artifact collection constructs a timeline of fashion trends suggesting three time periods: Wrap Turban Era (Early 20th Century-1975), French Coin Era (1975-2000), and Eclectic Fusion (2000-present). While there are published works about Hmong culture in the early California settlement, there is a lack of studies on current Hmong fashion and Hmong women. For this reason, this research will expand on the existing academic works and gallery archives of Hmong fashion.
