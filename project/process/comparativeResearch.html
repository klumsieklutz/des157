    <h2>
  Center for Hmong Arts and Talent
  </h2>

    <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know much about this website, but the reason why I decided to choose this website is because this website and I will some simlar audience, the Hmong Community. It also gives many resources and showcases a lot of Hmong Arts in Minnesota.
     </p>
      <br>
    <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon arrival on the home page, there is a huge amount of information thrown at me. I actually do not think that this webiste is well designed at all because the nav bar does not work. Also there is a collumn on the left with links, that does not work as well. Maybe this website is more of a blog because I do see similar design through the verticle newsfeed on the homepage. I believe this website isn't well maintain and that's why a lot of the links do not work. Maybe the reason why this site isn't well put together because it is power by wordpress. Overall, my user experience on this site was not that great, and I will use this site as an example of "What Not To Do."

    <h2>
  Revived
  </h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revived is a website is a non-profit organization that seeks the revival of Hmong cultural tectiles and the promotion of emerging designers on the runway and higher education. This webiste is similar to the one that I want to make because it's target audience in the Hmong community and others who are interested in about fashion.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, I believe that this site is very beautifully designed compare to how their old website on WIX used to look. The moment that you get on the page, there is an alert that asks if you want to be on their mailing page. I think that this alert is fairly simple and gorgeous. It matches the rest of the website's theme. On it's home page there seems to be nav bar that when you hover it, it fades to grey. This must have been made through JAVA, but to be honest I do not know. When these tabs are clicked the site changes like a slide show, horizontally. I would love to be able to learn how to do this. The font choice are well thought out because even though there is different fonts on the page, it keeps this simple elgenace. There are ways to get involve and a contact tab. It is very straight forward and user friendly because the user is not overwhelm with lots of writings. There are a lot of photos too.
