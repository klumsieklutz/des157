        In this audience test I had three girls who were interested in fashion to critique my user experience design. Overall they claim it to be very straight forward and and easy to navigate. However, there are a few minor mistakes such as choice of typography that isn't as legible. There may need to be more links that are more straight forward that will bring the user back to the home page. I was worry about the flat design, but the third tester claimed that flat designs are ok because it is in trend now.

      <p>What I intend to change after this audience test is going back to input the "under construction" pages such as the fashion timeline and the information about the authors. I do want to include more newsfeed so the user can tell that the home page is a interactive banner. And lastly, go back and fix the typography of the page for legibility and design aesthtics.
