        <h2>Title of Topic Choice is Subject to Change</h2>

        <p>I've decided to do my project on Hmong Women's Fashion because I feel that this topic is something I am very interested in knowing more about at the moment. The title is subject to change because my research partner and I have not officially came
            up with a name for our research yet. It keeps changing every week. Overall, this project will the trend in Hmong women's fashion in the pre 1970s to contemporary Hmong Fashion trend. In this project I will be working individually. </p>
