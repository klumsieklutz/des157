	<h3>Netflix</h3>
	<p>January 17, 12:15 pm</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this first blog entry on a user web interface that I admire is the Netflix phone app. I do believe that the app does a great job with laying out everything in an orderly manner. It maintains it's signature color that everyone recognizes it by, red and black. It is simple and informative. Its function is a bit standardize like the search button being on the right corner and the use of the hamburger navigation bar. I feel that netfliz have to do becaue it wants many people to use this app. Using Standardize features makes it easier for a lot of users to connect and understands its functions. Last but not least, the way it categorize its movies list is straight forward and uses an algorithm to pick movies that you as a user would like to watch. This is a concept that I have not understood yet and would like to be ablle to do this too.
